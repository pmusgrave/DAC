* Theory of Operation: This project demonstrates the capability of PSoC 4200L to 
* provide a high-quality audio playback and recording interface to a Windows or 
* Mac PC. The example uses the PSoC 4200L USB to implement an asynchronous USB 
* Audio Class v1.0 compliant device. The PSoC 4 L-Series Pioneer Kit has a 
* standard 3.5-mm TRRS audio jack onboard and an audio codec to convert digital 
* audio stream into analog and vice-versa. These components along with PSoC 4200L
* implement the complete USB Audio interface.
